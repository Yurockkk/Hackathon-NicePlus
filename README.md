Nice+ - No More Cyberbullying!

### What is Nice+?

Nice+ utilizes your social media information to help you figure out if you've ever harassed or said anything negative to an individual or a group of people online. Its very simple, we scan through all your Facebook posts and find your negative posts. Only you can see your negative posts in our app and from there you can take actionable steps to resolving the post by either deleting it, apologizing to the person or group you harassed, or ignore it if its a misunderstanding.

### How to build it?
1. `pod update` by CocaPods in the project dirctory.
2. Please use Xcode9 as the IDE.
